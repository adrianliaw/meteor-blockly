Core Blockly Blocks
===================

`meteor add blockly:blocks`
---------------------------

This package provides core blocks for `blockly:blockly`.  
You can play around with these blocks on [Blockly project page](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)  
The blocks are available via `Blockly.Blocks`.  

### Core Blocks
Core blocks set is a set of useful blocks which are commonly used.  
For example, "repeat n times, do ...", "if ... do ...".  
With or without the core blocks set, you can still define [custom blocks](https://developers.google.com/blockly/custom-blocks/overview)
